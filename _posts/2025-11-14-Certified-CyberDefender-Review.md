# **Certified CyberDefender (CCD) Review and Experience**

<img width="477" height="628" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54cb50d-2e73-4191-ba71-1f62db1f112e" />


The Certified CyberDefender (CCD) is a hands-on self-paced certification that covers a variety of security domains, including network forensics, forensic evidence collection, disk forensics, memory forensics, threat hunting, security operations, incident response, perimeter defence, and malware analysis. Note, the exam only assesses network, disk, and memory forensics, along with threat hunting.

At first glance, the CCD appears pricey, although relative to a university subject, it is extremely affordable and certainly worth the cost. You are provided with four months of lab access, lessons, two exam attempts, and access to special Discord channels.

Ultimately, the CCD was an incredible journey. For anyone on the fence about the certification, just give it a shot, you won’t regret it.

### **Prerequisites**

As explained by the CyberDefenders team, before taking the CCD you should have:

- 1+ years of experience in cybersecurity or a related IT field  
- A good understanding of Windows and Linux operating systems and networking fundamentals  
- Solid research and problem-solving skills

According to community posts and my own opinion, the CCD is an intermediate to advanced certification, on par with BTL2. You should have:

- A solid cybersecurity background (university, formal training, or work)
- A good understanding of Windows internals
- Strong networking knowledge

<br>

### **Exam**

The entire training takes around **2–3 months** if you allocate a couple of hours each day to studying, taking notes, and completing labs.

I highly recommend purchasing a **one-month Pro subscription** and doing additional labs before attempting the exam.

The exam is delivered entirely through the CyberDefenders platform. Once you start, you are given **48 hours** to complete it.

Key points:

- Divided into 4 sections
- All sections are accessible through the browser
- Each question has an answer field and an optional justification field
- Justification sections are useful for queries, reasoning, and evidence
- The exam is fully practical, no multiple choice

I personally spent around 20 hours completing the exam, although realistically 12–15 hours would have been enough.

### **General Exam Advice**

#### **Take Breaks**
- Make sure to take breaks, not just for eating, but also for relaxing. You have 48 hours, which doesn’t seem like a lot at first, but it’s plenty of time to complete the exam. 

#### **Don’t Panic**
- I really struggled in the beginning of the exam, I honestly thought there was no hope and that I’d certainly fail. Just make sure to try and remain positive, just because you can’t answer a question doesn’t mean you are going to fail. If you are stuck on a question, come back to it later, I can’t stress this enough, do not spend countless hours on questions that you are struggling with, unless you have gone through the entire exam. 

#### **Improve Your Notes**
- Notes and cheat sheets will be extremely important for saving time and reducing stress. Make sure you have well written notes and cheat sheets, including things like useful artifacts, queries, commonly used threat actor techniques, etc.

### **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**

Overall, the Certified CyberDefender (CCD) training was excellent, I’m certainly not the only one who believes it deserves an overwhelming amount of support, nonetheless, let’s delve into the pros and cons of this course: 
<br>

### **Pros**

#### **100% Practical**
- The certification markets itself as 100% practical. This is something I absolutely love and assure you to be true. Whilst some lessons feel a tad theory heavy, there are plenty of labs that go along with it. Furthermore, their CyberRange platform provides even more labs, which complements the CCD very well. When it comes to the exam, it is completely practical, there are no typical theory questions, you are required to perform real investigations and provide your answer and rationale. It does not have any multiple-choice crap that other certification exams rely on. 

#### **Well-Articulated Lessons**
- The theory in this training isn’t text heavy. Something most courses struggle with is taking complex topics and explaining it in digestible bite size chunks. The CyberDefeders team has done an incredible job at explaining concepts, not just dumping paragraphs upon paragraphs of text and praying that you understand it. This makes taking notes and digesting concepts easier. 

#### **Mindset Improvement**
- Whilst this is not directly taught in the certification, the CCD training does a great job at improving your mindset. Prior to undertaking this certification, I thought my approach to problem solving was matured. I learnt quite quickly that this wasn’t completely the case. Not only does the CCD provide a bunch of practical experience, but you also learn how to research, how to approach problems, and much more. You aren’t hand fed everything in this certification, the labs, module investigations, and the exam require you to research and leverage knowledge that the training did not directly teach. I think this is incredible, rather than just assessing your ability to take effective notes, the CyberDefenders team ensures that you can solve problems you haven’t faced before.   

#### **Incredible Community**
- The CyberDefenders community is amazing, both the public and private discord channels are full of helpful conversations. If you ever need assistance with a lesson or lab, the team and community is more than happy to lend you a hand. 

#### **Realistic Training**
- The labs are extremely relevant; I came across multiple threat actor techniques in labs that I directly observed during my internship with a DFIR team. 


#### **Tool Exposure**
- Through doing all the training, you get exposure to numerous tools, including, but not limited to: ELK, Wireshark, Zui, NetworkMiner, EZ Tools, UserAssist, Event Log Explorer, Regripper, DB Browser for SQLite, USB Forensic Tracker (USBFT), Volatility 2, R-Studio, and much more.

### **Cons**

*Note: I genuinely had to dig deep to find any cons.*

#### **Market Presence**
- Unfortunately, the CCD lacks the market presence that certifications like those from Comptia and BTL1/2 have. If you are looking for a certification to chuck on your resume and help land an interview, the CCD just isn’t there yet. I’m personally fine with this, I chose to embark on the CCD journey because I loved their platform and knew I would learn a lot. If you are looking for HR recognition, go with a cert like the security+, but if you want to actually learn something and enjoy the process, take the CCD or BTL1/2. 

#### **Depth**
- Some topics lack the level of depth that I’d like. Whilst I truly do believe this course covers plenty, I would love for some topics to be explored in more detail. For instance, some of the artifacts explored in the disk forensics module could use some more detail. 

#### **Real-World Context**
- Some lessons lack real world contextual information. What I mean by this is that, take for instance the disk forensics module, when covering artifacts like LNK files, I believe real world examples of how they can be useful would really help with understanding the topic better. The CyberDefenders team should consider adding more real-world examples or stories that supplement theory. 

#### **Video Content**
- Most of the course is text and lab based, however, there are some videos. Unfortunately, these videos are essentially just a video representation of a text-based lesson. It would be beneficial to include videos that cover important topics in more depth. I’m personally more of a visual learner; therefore, videos don’t necessarily click with me, however, I do love reading a topic first and then watching videos to help retain information. I understand it would be a strenuous task, but providing more video content that explains things more casually would likely benefit a lot of people. 


#### **Exam Feedback**
- Unfortunately, due to the nature of this exam, you are not provided with incredible feedback. I understand the reason behind this, therefore it’s not entirely fair to include this as a con, however, it is relatively annoying. My feedback personally can be seen below:

### **Final Thoughts**
The CCD is one of the most rewarding, practical, and well-designed cybersecurity certifications available. If you’re looking for a certification that genuinely improves your DFIR abilities rather than testing memorisation, this is the one.
