# Malicious Word Document Analysis

This document provides an analysis of a suspicious [Microsoft Word document](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse.php?search=file_type%3Adocx) flagged as malicious. This analysis was conducted using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques, utilising tools to dissect and analyse the file to uncover its behaviour. Please note that I am in no way shape or form an experienced malware analyst, I am simply trying to learn so any feedback or advice is much appreciated. 

### **File Identification**

The file was confirmed to be a Microsoft Word document using tools such as trid and the file utility.

### **Macro Detection and Behaviour**

Using [oleid](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/oleid), a python script that analyse OLE files like Microsoft Office documents, I was able to discover the presence of embedded VBA macros.

I confirmed this using another tool called [olevba](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olevba) which is able to detect and extract VBA macros among other pieces of crucial information.

To analyse the VBA macros, I used oledump to find the location of these Macros and dump them:

- **Object 7:** Writes and executes a file named auxiliary2.aux, likely a malicious payload. This macro leverages the AutoOpen function for immediate execution upon running the document.

- **Object 10:** Executes the auxiliary file through a function named Calculate_values.

- **Object 11:** Attaches a malicious template (Base.dotm or Normal.dotm) for persistence. It also employs anti-analysis techniques, such as deleting macro code after execution.

- **Object 12:** Determines the system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) and reads binary data, likely to deliver an appropriate payload. 
- **Objects 13 and 14:** Contain obfuscated, decimal-encoded data. After decoding using a custom python script and cyberchef, it was revealed that these macros generate and write a Portable Executable (PE) file to disk.

### **Obfuscated Payload Analysis**

Using a custom python script as seen below, the obfuscated macros in objects 13 and 14 were decoded, revealing 2 PE files. The extracted fileâ€™s SHA256 hashes were checked on VirusTotal, both receiving a large number of detections.

**Network Indicators:**
- An IP address embedded in PE file was identified but it had no detection on VirusTotal.

### **Dynamic Analysis**

The two extracted PE files were subjected to sandbox testing using Hybrid-Analysis. The dynamic analysis confirmed the malicious nature of the PE file but did not uncover new indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Next steps would be to analyse the two PE files using a sandbox like FLARE VM or AnyRun, to uncover more IOCs.
