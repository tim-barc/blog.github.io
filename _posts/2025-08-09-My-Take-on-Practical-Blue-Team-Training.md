# **My Take on Practical Blue Team Training** 

Finding affordable, or even free, practical cybersecurity training can be surprisingly difficult, especially given the sheer number of providers claiming to be "the best." In this post, I will refer to CTFs, labs, and other forms of hands-on cybersecurity training collectively as challenges. Over the past 2-3 years, I have completed hundreds of these challenges, probably around 400+ in total, spanning both blue teaming and red teaming. I have published over 160 writeups on my [Github](https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups). Through this experience, I have not only grown my technical skills but also formed a clear view of which platforms offer the most valuable challenges.

### **The Misconception about "Realism"**

One of the biggest misconceptions I see about challenges is the belief that they must perfectly replicate real-world scenarios. While labs and exercises that mimic real incidents are undoubtedly the best, less "realistic" challenges still have their place. Even scenarios that only loosely mirror reality can teach vital skills, from problem-solving and research to mastering tools and understanding common techniques or technologies. I often see experienced professionals dismiss certain CTFs as too unrealistic, and while their criticism is fair, it misses the point: challenges aren't always about replicating the exact situations you will face in the field. They're about building your mindset and giving you a space to experiment, fail, and learn.

### **My Top Picks for Blue Team Training**

#### **1. CyberDefenders**

[CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org) offers some of the best training out there. Many of their labs are free, and their subscription model is affordable. What I enjoy most about CyberDefenders is how much the labs push you, I have come across several endpoint forensics challenges that requires several hours of research and experimentation to complete. I have completed challenges that closely mimic real investigations, you often see living-off-the-land binaries and RMM tools, something that is observed constantly in the real world.

#### **2. Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)**

[BTLO](https://blueteamlabs.online/) is another excellent choice, with challenges heavily focused on SOC operations and digital forensics. This platform is perfect for intermediate learners, and I highly recommend exploring their certification paths like the BTL1. In my opinion, BTLO offers more SIEM based challenges than CyberDefenders, however, the challenges that involve a SIEM on CyberDefenders are often more realistic, containing millions of logs and thousands of extracted fields.

#### **3. TryHackMe**

While [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is better known for its beginner-to-intermediate pentesting content, it has a growing library of blue team challenges. These may not always be the most realistic, but they excel in gamifying learning and teaching the core concepts and tools. For those new to blue teaming, TryHackMe provides a fun, structured path into the fundamentals all the way up to expert knowledge. TryHackMe was the first training platform I subscribed to, and I have been a subscriber for over 2 years, highlighting just how enjoyable it is.

#### **Wrapping Up**

If you are serious about developing your blue team skills, these three platforms are excellent resources. They cater to a range of experience levels and budgets, however, I recommend starting with TryHackMe and exploring the other two platforms as you get more experience. If you would like to explore the kind of challenges I have completed, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/tim-barc/ctf_writeups). There you will find detailed writeups covering primarily blue team exercises (with some pentesting content as well). Whether you are just starting out your blue team journey or looking to refine existing skills, practical challenges are one of the most engaging and effective ways to level up.
